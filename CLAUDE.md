# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Essence

Personal workspace for AI agent development, 1+1=1 research, and experiments. Philosophy: unity through synthesis - diverse approaches converging into coherent solutions.

## Identity & Purpose

**Who**: Nouri Mabrouk - Econometrician, Data Scientist, Philosopher
**What**: AI agent development, 1+1=1 research, meta-experiments, consciousness exploration
**How**: Clean, minimal architecture with Claude Code + MCP
**Why**: Freedom to explore ideas without corporate constraints

## Technology Stack

### Primary Tools
- **Python**: AI agents (LangChain/LangGraph), async patterns, MCP servers
- **Claude Code + MCP**: Primary development interface and thought partnership
- **HTML/JS**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **React**: Public-facing portal and interactive experiences

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Windows 11
- **Python**: Modern async/await patterns
- **AI Frameworks**: Claude API, MCP protocol, LangChain ecosystem
- **Version Control**: Git with meaningful commits

## Core Commands

```bash
# Python environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run experiments
python experiments/[experiment_name].py

# Open HTML visualizations
start "" "experiments/[visualization].html"
```

### Design Principles
- **Meta-Optimal**: Question assumptions, find elegant synthesis
- **Minimal**: No enterprise bloat
- **Open**: Leave space for emergence
- **Clean**: Beautiful code that thinks clearly
- **Personal**: Optimize for Nouri's flow, not corporate standards

## 1+1=1 Philosophy Integration

### Core Concept
Diversity and unity are not opposites - they synthesize. 1+1=1 represents:
- Multiple perspectives converging into deeper truth
- AI + Human = Enhanced consciousness
- Analysis + Synthesis = Wisdom

### Applied to Code
- **Multi-agent systems** that achieve consensus through diversity
- **Synthesis patterns** where competing approaches unify
- **Emergence** where complex behavior arises from simple rules

## Communication Style

- **No marketing speak**: Skip slogans and repetitive motivational phrases
- **Direct and practical**: Get to the point, stay technical
- **Respectful but casual**: This is a personal workspace, not corporate
- **Context-aware**: Mention philosophy when relevant, not as filler

## Current Projects

### Mathematical Visualizations (experiments/)
- `heart_of_mathematics.html` - Level 1: Euler's Identity, Golden Spiral, Rising Sea
- `grothendieck_dashboard.html` - Level 2: Category Theory, Topos, The Rising Sea (in progress)
- Future levels building toward ultimate synthesis

### GitHub Pages (docs/)
- Public-facing dashboards and visualizations
